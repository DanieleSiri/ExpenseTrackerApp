# ExpenseTrackerApp
my basic implementation of a webapp for tracking expenses with python, docker and mongodb

To run the app you can manually use docker-compose modifying the MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME, MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD, expense_username, expense_password environment variables to the desired values
or you can run the script expense.sh
